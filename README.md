# c-project.train-tickets-management
This is a C language project I made that manages train tickets using 5 trains with classes as an example, I used 2 files as outputs in this project which are the tickets file and the clients file (each containing their respectful infos), it's also worth mentioning that I used pointers which can seem more complex in the code but made it easier to manipulate the files and the infos.
